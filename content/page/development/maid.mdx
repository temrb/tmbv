**Vibe coding** is when you jump straight into building through AI prompting with no planâ€”just a feeling. It feels fast, but this path almost always leads to a fragile foundation that cracks under pressure.

Without a clear blueprint, the AI develops _amnesia_, changing styles and logic mid-project. This inevitably leads to scope creep, where the original problem gets lost in a half-finished product riddled with disorganized code and unexpected bugs.

Instead of building on a vibe, let's build from a blueprint. The following steps provide the clarity and structure needed to create robust, scalable applications.

## Conversational Research

The first and most critical step is **dialogue**. This isn't a casual chat; it's a structured conversation that prevents "vibe coding" by moving from a high-level vision to a concrete technical path. This phase has two parts: a flexible **Socratic Funnel** to define your goals, followed by **Deep Research** to validate the technical approach.

This process adapts to you. A non-technical founder might spend more time on the _Why_, while a senior engineer might focus on the _How_. The goal is the same: clarity.

### The Socratic Funnel

You'll use an AI like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) as a partner to progress through three distinct stages.

<Steps>
  <Step title='The "Why" (High-Level Vision)'>
    Focus entirely on the human element. This stage is about defining the user's pain point and the ultimate goal, using simple, non-technical language.

    **Key Questions to Explore:**
    - Who is this for?
    - Is this an internal tool or a public-facing product?
    - What specific problem does this solve for them?
    - What does success look like from their perspective?

  </Step>
  <Step title='The "What" (Functional Requirements)'>
    Translate the vision into tangible features and behaviors. You're defining what the system must *do* without yet deciding on the technology.

    **Key Questions to Explore:**
    - What are the core features needed for an MVP?
    - What kind of data will the system handle?
    - Are there critical needs like speed, security, or scale?

  </Step>
  <Step title='The "How" (Technical Exploration)'>
    Once the "what" is clear, you can explore the "how." This is where a non-technical person can ask the AI for suggestions, and a technical person can validate their ideas.

    **Key Questions to Explore:**
    - Based on our needs, what technologies are a good fit?
    - What are the trade-offs between different frameworks?
    - What would a basic system architecture look like?

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
	The key is to address the stages in order, ensuring your technical decisions
	are driven by a clear purpose. Move through the funnel at your own pace.
</Info>

### Deep Research

With a list of potential technologies from "The How," you're ready to transition from conversation to documentation. Task the AI with conducting **deep research** to generate a formal analysis report. This deliverable should outline all viable tools and libraries, provide a comparison matrix of pros and cons for your use case, offer a clear recommendation, and discuss any integration considerations that might affect the overall architecture.

### Putting It All Together: A Scenario

Let's see how this research phase works for a non-technical user who wants to build an `internal web scraping tool`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The dialogue begins with a vague idea..." icon="user">
    **User:** "I need a way to get data from websites."
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title='The AI probes for purpose' icon='robot'>
	**AI:** "Okay, let's explore that. What's the main goal? What will you
	**do** with this data once you have it?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='The user reveals the core motivation' icon='user'>
	**User:** "I want to feed it into another AI to train a custom model for my
	business. The data needs to be high quality."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='The AI defines functional needs...' icon='robot'>
	**AI:** "Got it. That means accuracy and structure are key. What kind of
	websites are we talking about? Simple articles, or complex pages like
	e-commerce sites where you have to click things to see information?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='...and the user provides critical details' icon='user'>
	**User:** "Both, actually. Some are simple blogs, but others are product
	pages where prices and reviews appear dynamically."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='The AI synthesizes and suggests a path forward' icon='robot'>
	**AI:** "Perfect. So we need an internal tool that can scrape both static
	and dynamic sites and output clean, structured data. Based on that, we
	should explore technologies that can control a browser, like **Playwright**,
	combined with a library like **Pydantic** to enforce data structure. Does
	this sound like the right direction?"
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The user asks the final, informed question" icon="user">
    **User:** "Yes, that's exactly it. What are the pros and cons of those tools you mentioned compared to others?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### From Dialogue to Deep Research

That final question is the perfect outcome of the Socratic funnel. The user started with a vague idea ("get data") and ended with a specific, well-defined query ("pros and cons of these tools"). This question now becomes the direct prompt for the AI's analysis report.

**Example AI Report:**

```yaml
Tool Analysis Report:
    - BeautifulSoup: Best for simple HTML parsing. Fast and lightweight.
    - Scrapy: Excellent for large-scale, production-level scraping.
    - Playwright: Ideal for modern, JavaScript-heavy sites.
    - Selenium: Good for complex browser interactions but can be slower.

Recommendation: Playwright + structured output with Pydantic.
Reasoning: Handles modern web apps, offers fast execution, and ensures type-safe outputs for reliable data processing.
```
