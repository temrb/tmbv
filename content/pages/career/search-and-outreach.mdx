## Advanced Job Search

The first step to landing an interview is finding the right job.
I've built a [powerful job search tool](https://go.tmbv.me/ajs) that helps you find the exact job that you're looking for.
You can filter by job title, location, company, and more.

<Tip>
  Initially limiting your search to the **last 1 to 5 days** can enhance your application's visibility to recruiters.

This is because most job boards prioritize applications based on submission date, with the latest submissions appearing at the top of the list.

Thus, hiring teams usually follow a **First In, First Out [(FIFO)](https://youtu.be/1WwhfB3Rs14?si=eWBWaKzkFGW2AT7B&t=159)** approach for **reviewing applications**,
meaning the earlier you apply, the better your chances of being seen.

This is in contrast to i.e. BIFO (Best In, First Out) when presenting candidates or LIFO (Last In, First Out) for laying off employees ðŸ˜„.

</Tip>

This tool works by **accepting user inputs** like job title or different experience levels a user may want to target or negate.
It then **uses these inputs to generate a search query** that can be used to search for jobs on different job boards like LinkedIn, Ashby, Greenhouse, and more.

### Scenario

You're a student looking for a summer internship in software engineering.

	alt='Screenshot of Advanced Job Search interface showing software engineering internship filters and results'
/>

For example, if you click `Open` on the Greenhouse result, you'll be taken to google.com with the following google search query:

```
site:boards.greenhouse.io/* (inurl:"/job/" OR inurl:"/jobs/" OR inurl:"/apply/") intitle:"software engineer" (intitle:"intern" OR intitle:"internship")
```

View the Greenhouse result by clicking [here](<https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aboards.greenhouse.io%2F*%20inurl%3A%22%2Fjobs%2F%22%20%22Apply%20for%20this%20Job%22%20intitle%3A%22software%20engineer%22%20(intitle%3A%22intern%22%20OR%20intitle%3A%22internship%22)%20-%222%20years%22%20-%222%2B%20years%22%20-%223%20years%22%20-%223%2B%20years%22%20-%224%20years%22%20-%224%2B%20years%22%20-%225%20years%22%20-%225%2B%20years%22>).

## Autofill Job Application

Now from the search result above, let's say you found a job that you're interested in...

<img
	aria-label='Software Engineering Internship at Greenhouse'
	src='https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%209.44.54%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056216129'
	alt='Software Engineering Internship at Greenhouse'
/>

When you visit the job application page, you can use the [Simplify Autofill](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simplify-copilot-autofill/pbanhockgagggenencehbnadejlgchfc) Chrome extension to fill out the application with a single click.

<img
	aria-label='Job Application Page - Simplify CoPilot Autofill'
	src='https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%2010.33.35%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056216097'
	alt='Job Application Page - Simplify CoPilot Autofill'
/>

Here, if you click `LET'S DO IT!` on the extension popup, it'll **autofill** the application form with the details you've provided during onboarding.

	src='https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%2010.38.22%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056215969'
	alt='Simplify CoPilot - Filling'
/>

## Finding Outreach Contacts

<Warning>
	Skip this section if the **hiring team** exists in the job description.
</Warning>

After applying to the job above, you can use [LinkedIn search](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/) to find people who work at the company you're applying to.

### LinkedIn People Search

For example, if you're looking for contacts at Neuralink, you can set the following filters:

- Type: `People`
- Location: `United States`
- Current Company: `Neuralink`
- Profile Language: `English`
- Title Keywords: `recruiter` (or any other relevant title)

<img
	aria-label='LinkedIn People Search'
	src='https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%2011.02.23%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056216143'
	alt='LinkedIn People Search'
/>

Here, you can see a list of `recruiters` in `United States` who work at `Neuralink`.

## Reaching Out

Finally, you can use [this simple outreach templating tool](https://go.tmbv.me/app-outreach) to create personalized connection notes or InMails for any LinkedIn contact.
You can always _customize the output message_ to fit your needs. ðŸ˜„

Let's say you want to reach out to Laura (from the result above). You can use the outreach templating tool to create a personalized message for them.

<img
	aria-label='Outreach Templating - Laura example'
	src='https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%2011.20.59%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056216172'
	alt='Outreach Templating - Laura'
/>

Below, you have two different outreach messages that you can use to reach out to Laura.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cold Outreach">
    If the person you're reaching out to works at the company you're applying to, but **isn't the direct hiring manager or recruiter** for the role.

    <img
      aria-label="Cold Outreach"
      src="https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%2011.21.05%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056216033"
      alt="Cold Outreach"
    />

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Warm Outreach">
    If the person you're reaching out to **is the direct hiring manager or recruiter** for the role.

    <img
      aria-label="Warm Outreach"
      src="https://ik.imagekit.io/pqnkhqkwi/tmbv/complete%20job%20search%20guide/Screenshot%202024-02-18%20at%2011.21.12%20PM.png?updatedAt=1755056216081"
      alt="Warm Outreach"
    />

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
	Messages are short (and to the point) so they can be used as `connection
	notes` on LinkedIn or as the body of an InMail.
</Note>

You can copy the message and use it to reach out to Laura on LinkedIn. This is a great way to get in touch with someone who might help you get your application noticed!

	alt='Finished Outreach Message - Laura example'

## ðŸŽ‰ Done!
