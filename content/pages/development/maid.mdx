## First, what's vibe coding?

**Vibe coding** is when you jump straight into building through AI prompting by prompting AI with no plan, just a feeling. It feels fast but often leads to:

- **Fragile Foundations** - Code that breaks the moment you try to scale it
- **AI Amnesia** - The AI changes style and architecture mid-project due to lack of a clear blueprint
- **Scope Creep** - Ending up with a half-finished product that fails to solve the original problem
- **Messy Code** - Disorganized code, unexpected bugs, and an overall lack of clear direction
